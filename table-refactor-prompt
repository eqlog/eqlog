// AI: This function generates code using old style tables.
// Migrate towards the new table types.
// Fix this function only, nothing else.
// Its public signature should stay the same, unless it takes parameters as
// strings, e.g. rel: &str instead of rel: rel, or for arity etc.
// In that case, please migrate it towards taking an eqlog and identifiers
// value and whatever else is needed and generate the strings/displayable values
// there.
// Note that the new tables differ from the old style tables in that
// - Rows are represented as fixed-size arrays now, not tuples
// - The individual entries in rows are now u32, whereas for the old style tables they're newtype
//   wrappers around those ids. Those newtype wrappers stay the same, but when interacting with
//   tables they're not used anymore.
// Observe also that most of the functions (except for the drop fns) are actually safe to call, so
// no need to insert unsafe blocks.
// AI!
